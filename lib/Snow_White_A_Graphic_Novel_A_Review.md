The book follows the story of Snow White, a young girl whose father is a wealthy businessman and whose stepmother is a ruthless actress. When her father dies mysteriously, Snow White is left at the mercy of her stepmother, who hires a hitman to kill her. Snow White escapes and finds refuge with a group of seven street kids who live in an abandoned subway station.

If you are looking for a graphic novel that is both familiar and fresh, Snow White: A Graphic Novel is a great choice. It is a book that will appeal to both children and adults, and will make you see the fairy tale in a new light.
  
One of the themes that Phelan explores in his graphic novel is the contrast between appearance and reality. The book shows how appearances can be deceiving, and how people can hide their true intentions behind masks and mirrors. For example, the stepmother is a glamorous actress who uses her beauty and charm to manipulate others, but she is also a cold-hearted murderer who will stop at nothing to get rid of Snow White. The magic stock ticker is another example of how appearances can be misleading, as it seems to offer the stepmother the truth, but it also drives her to madness and obsession.
 
Another theme that Phelan examines in his graphic novel is the role of fate and free will. The book suggests that some events are predetermined by destiny, such as Snow White's birth and survival, while others are influenced by human choices, such as the stepmother's actions and the street kids' loyalty. The book also raises questions about whether people can change their fate or escape their past, as Snow White tries to start a new life in the city, but is haunted by her stepmother's pursuit.
 
A third theme that Phelan portrays in his graphic novel is the impact of social and historical context on people's lives. The book depicts how the Great Depression affected different classes of society, from the rich to the poor, and how it created a sense of despair and desperation among many people. The book also shows how some historical figures and events influenced the story, such as Harry Houdini, who inspired Snow White's father and his magic tricks, and the Wall Street Crash of 1929, which triggered the downfall of Snow White's family.
